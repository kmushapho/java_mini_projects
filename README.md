# java_mini_projects

Welcome to the Java Mini Projects repository! This is a collection of small Java projects that I am working on to learn and explore Java programming. Each project focuses on different concepts and techniques, providing hands-on experience to enhance my skills in Java development.

Feel free to clone this repository, explore the projects, contribute, or offer suggestions to improve the code!

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. Mastermind

    - A simple implementation of the popular game Mastermind, where the player must guess a sequence of numbers.

    - Concepts covered: Loops, Arrays, Input/Output, and Game Logic.

2. Hangman

    - The classic word-guessing game Hangman, where the player must guess the letters in a word within a limited number of tries.

    - Concepts covered: Arrays, Strings, Loops, Conditional Statements.

   - Click the "Fork" button to create a copy in your GitHub account

2. Clone your forked repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kmushapho/java_mini_projects.git
    ```

3.  Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or another Java IDE)

The projects are designed to be run in a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA. Ope

4. Compile and run a project

    Each project is contained in its own folder. For example, to run the Hangman project, navigate to the hangman/ folder, then find the relevant .java file inside the src/ directory.``

    Hereâ€™s how you can compile and run the Java files for each project:

    1. Navigate to the folder

    ```bash
    cd hangman/src
    ```

    2. Compile the Java file

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

    3. Run the compiled Java class
    
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you would like to contribute to any of the projects, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Suggestions for new features or improvements are also encouraged!
